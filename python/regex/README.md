# Python Regular Expression Examples
This repository includes simple examples of using regular expressions to find/replace things.

All examples use the `test_text.txt` file.

All code snippets are in the `examples.py` file, and include what the expected output is, in comments.

## Resources
- The website [http://www.pyregex.com/](http://www.pyregex.com/) provides an uncluttered interface for testing regular expressions in Python.
- A simple, but authoritative overview of regular expressions in Python, is at [https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html#regex-howto](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html#regex-howto)
