# Natural Language Toolkit
This directory consists of pre-built code snippets that leverage the Natural Language Toolkit library, which does not come with Python's Standard library.

Many of the examples herein are slightly modified versions of what can be found at http://www.nltk.org/howto/, which is also far more extensive than what is here.

### Prerequsisites
You will need to install the NTLK library. Fortunately, this is pretty easy on all operating systems. See http://www.nltk.org/install.html
